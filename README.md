# __Christmas Website 2022__
This is a website I built around Christmas to keep on top of my Web Development skills over the holiday season. Here you can find some facts about Christmas, some Christmas themed jokes, a quiz to test your knowledge about Christmas and a meet the team page for Santa Claus and his reindeer!

Most page content was generated using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). The Christmas Quiz and countdown in the facts page were built using JavaScript and the rest of the site was built with HTML and CSS using the [Materialize framework](https://materializecss.com/).

I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas and avery happy New Year!
